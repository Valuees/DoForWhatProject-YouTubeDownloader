# YouTubeDownloader - consloeApp
I created a program that wasn't really necessary. 
This program uses the **YT-DLP** and **FFMPEG** libraries for downloading audio or video clips from YouTube. 
I wrote it in terminal format. Of course, **YT-DLP** is much easier to use than this program.
I made it like mini project for study C programming ,idk it's just a student project Haha.
I also give the sauce code of this program.

## Set-up
1. Create Folder 
2. move the .exe file to that Folder you just Create
3. create program shortcut for easy use
4. run program
